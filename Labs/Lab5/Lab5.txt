Random byte generator
  - print to standard out -> character
  - byte has 8 bits of representation
  - characters are signed
  --> use unsigned chars
  printf("%c", value);
  ./randgenerator <size> | head ...| ./entropyCalc
                                  > test

Entropy calculator
  - Cisco code
    -> 1st 2 are one block
    -> 3rd is separate

  READ AS unsigned

Entropy:
  7.999
  7.9999
  8 is ideal

Writeup
  1)  measurements for 3 different file sizes (random gen)
  2)  masurements from 3 different sample files (3 different file types) -> keep constant file size
  3)  Discuss the results and provide explanation of our random byte generator
