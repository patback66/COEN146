EXTENSION OF LAB 3

Client
------
send data to server
receive data from the server
check for sequence & checksum
  T: send next
  F: resend last


Server
------
receive data from client
check for sequence & checksum
  T:  modify the packet according to assignment description {print}
  F:  Do not modify the packet, toupper()
send data


Should be using structs
  change input type to struct, different size

struct packet {
  unsigned short seq;
  unsigned short checksum;
  char msg[64];
};

struct packet p;
p.checksum=17;

can use predefined strings -> 1 string per packet, send 5 separate packets
char *msgs[5] = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"};

sizeof(struct packet)

TEASER: IS sizeof(struct_)==sizeof(sturct_*)

How would you get the address of the third struct in an array of structs?
