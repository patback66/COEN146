ICMP
  - Internet Control Messaging Protocol
  - Layer 3 sort of, but more Layer 4
    - It's an application, control protocol that manages the layer beneath it

4/5 Encoding
  - Special Characters -> start/end character, framing
  - Pass data that isn't interpreted as data

Most important node in a graph?
  - Look at it's connections -> does it have a lot?
  - Most amount of reliable connections?
  - "I am Bob next to Alice"
  - Distance -> direct or roundabout (but shorter)
    - But the node needs to know about the path

Routers
  - can't just broadcast when in doubt
  - View of who can be reached
  - Distance Vector routing
    - problems when a node disappears

Network Graphs
  D   D,0
  D   D,0
      C,2
  D   D,0
      C,2
      E,(C,2),7
      B,(C,10),15
      A,10,A

BGP
  - Border Gateway Protocol
    - "Neighbors, who do you know?"
      - Keeps a summary
  - Trust routers to trust each other
  - Routing style effects how you trust other routers and data

Link State Routing
  - Only what you heard firsthand?
    - Every node say who it can immediately reach, and cost
      -

Layer 2
  Distance Vector routing
    - propagate who you can eventually reach
    - talk to neighbors about everyone
  Link State Routing
    - share beyond immediate neighbors
    - share only who you can directly reach
    - talk to everyone only about your immediate neighbors

Building Link State Packets
  - need to know age of packet
  - Routing table
    - decide which outbox to put the packet in

How often should you decide the best route? Very often
  - Opposite: set in stone, never update
  - Extreme: every packet
  - So how often do you calculate the best route?

Basic operation of: Distance Vector Routing, Link state routing

Chapter 3: first 2 sections on switches

Next class: will be a review session

Wireless vs ethernet
  - have to worry about people talking over each other
    - used MAC for ethernet
  -

RTS vs CTS
  Request to send
  Clearance to send

NEXT TUESDAY: MIDTERM
Really only responsible for sections in weekly readings
Question: Do I know why?
