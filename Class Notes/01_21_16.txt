COEN 146: Computer Networks

Link Layer
  - assumes 2 things are already linked and communicating
    - there should be a physical connection

Frequency Division multiplexing
Time Division multiplexing
  - like taking turns

Sliding Window Protocol
  - potentially slow to send one thing at a time
  - 3 Roles
    - Reliable
    - Preserve the order
      - each frame has a sequence number
    - Frame Control
      - Reciver is able to throttle the sender
        - keeps the sender from overruning the receiver

Aloha Protocol
  - send data in short individual packets, fixed sized, burst
  - Small vulnerable period
  - Pure vs Slotted aloha
  - Persistent and nonpersistent CSMA
    - timer, but also check if somebody is talking before transmitting
    - don't necessarily try again immediately - flip a coin
      - if success - try agian
      - if fail - wait then try
    - back off a random amount of time and try again
  -   CSMA/CD

CSMA wtih Collision Detection
  - send the packet, then see what happens to it
  - CSMA/CD can be in one of three states: contention, transmission, or idle
  - Time at risk is not time to transmit
  - Use a small period to signal intention to transmit
  - Guarantee no colissions? Add traffic lights

Signal collision
  - colliding signals corrupt each other

Collision-Free Protocols
  - bit-map protocol
  - Contention period
    - reserve right to transmit in time slot

Adaptive Tree Walk Protocol - don't need to know

Ethernet
  - Aloha protocol applied to guided medium
    - can use any frequency
  - Most successful local are networking tecnology of last 20 years
  - Developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Centers (PARC)
  - Uses CSMA/CD
    - carrier sense Multiple access with collision detection
    - media access control
    - set of nodes send and receive frames over a shared link
    - Carrier sense means that all nodes can distinguish between an idle and a busy link
    - exponential backoff if collision
  - Uses ALOHA (packet radio network) as the root protocol
  - Dec and Intel join to define 10-Mbps protocol
  - Formed basis for IEEE 802.3
  - extened to include 100-Mbps and 1000-Mbps
    - Fast, gigabit
  - Can't have more than a certain length - because of latency

Ethernet Frame
  - Minimum frame size
    - because of cable length issue
  - Transceiver and adaptor
    - old - coax cable with t-connector
  - Ethernet repeater
  - Ethernet Hub - hubs connected, connects computers. Then you don't take out the network when you unplug
  - But might want a switch, not a hub

IEEE 802.11 - Collision Avoidance
  - Consider: send/receive where nodes overlap with carrier but not each other

MAC Addresses
  - how do you tell different nodes from each other?
    - MAC address tells the end address - every physical interface has this
    - physical address of the card
    - Every single ethernet card has a unique address
    - Devices with the same address need  to be on different networks - the adapter just shouldn't see 2 of the same directly connected
  - Networking: layer 3
