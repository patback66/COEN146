What do we need to know? Specific Algorithms (that aren't so specific)
Detailed material you need to know
  - reading material
    = no specific algorithm

Why not asked to memorize?
  Technology keeps changing

Chapter 8

Key Pre Distribution
  - Pre-Distribution of Symmetric keys
    = Authentication Protocols
    = Like challenge-response protocol
    = Prove you are bob, give secret key
    = Timestamp -> prove it's a current message, not old
  - Public-key authentication protocol that depends on synchronization
  - Sliding window protocols -> get a missing packet
  - A public-key authentication protocol that does not
      = send your clock time
  - The Needham-Schroeder authentication protocol
    = Key, but also identity. Only works for Alice
    = send back slightly different message -> decrypted & read, now send n+1
    = Now Alice knows Bob is Bob and Bob knows Alice is Alice.
  - Diffie-hellman key Agreement
    = exchange primes
    = g^ab mod p = (g^b mod p)^a
    = g^ba mod p = (g^a mod p)^b

Session Keys
  - don't want somebody to have possession of encrypted key for a long amount of time
  - prevent brute force

Pre-Distribution of Symmetric keys
  - Man-in-the-middle attack
  - Inserted into a handshake that is vulnerable
  - Establish secure connections

PGP - Pretty good privacy
  - Sign using Alice's private key
  - Encrypt using a newly generate one-time session key
  - Encrypt the session key using

Example Systems
  -Secure Shell (SSH)
    = Automated challenge-response
    = SSH often takes the place of the secure layer (that doesn't exist)
    = TCP Tunneling, port forwarding
    = almost like having a vpn
  - Transport Layer Security (TLS, SSL, HTTPS)
    = handshake protocol


Reflection attack

Security material
  - one-way hashes
  - public key encryption vs symmetric key encryption
  - how to do handshakes (more than just challenge/response)
  - attacks: reflection, mitm, replay
    = time and nonces to avoid replay

Coverage for final
  10-15 sample posted today
  Quiz 5

Final is not comprehensive: starts with second part of routing
  - around link-state on
    = didn't cover mobile ad-hoc networks
    = 2nd half layer 3 up

quiz access code: timing

latency doesn't really go away (apart from quantum level stuff)
