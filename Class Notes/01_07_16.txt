Networks - communication

How to buffer data

Latency	-	the time between starting to send the data and the data starting to be received
		-	time in flight

Bandwidth - how much data is moving with respect to unit time

Client 	-	intitiates the communication
		-	


Server	-	known point of contact
		-	many-to-one
		-	where the data is stored and distributed from

Home Network Applications
	-	Video streaming service: everybody is a server and a client
	-	Server - need to know who to talk to
		-1) ask me for movies
		-2) ask me where to find the movies
	-	How many messages need to be sent?
	-	Terms

Mobile Network Users
	-	IP Changes
	-	Must support mobility of the machine
	-	Wireless but not mobile

Network Hardware
	-	different levels
	-	network of networks
	-	Local Area Networks, Metropolitan Area Networks, Wide Area Networks, Wireless Network, Home Network, Internetworks

Broadcast Newtorks
	-	Broadcast links
		-	tell everybody
	-	Point-to-Point links

Local Area Networks
	-	Bus
		-	everybody hears and interprets at about the same time
		-	6-way stop sign
	-	Ring 
		-	has extra delay - must be heard, interpreted, and passed
		-	roundabout
	-	Media access control

Metropolitan Area networks

Wide Area Networks
	-	Geographical distance may incur more latency
	-	Subnets, routers link LANS
	-	Subnet - subcomponent of a larger network
	-	Router - sends data, evaluates best path
			   - forwards packets to proper path
	-	Packet - fixed size chunk of data sent at layer 3 (of layer stack) - link layer

Home Network Categories

Network Software
	-	Protocol Hierarchies

Protocol Hierarchies
	-	Flow supporting virtual communications in layers
	-	Data may have to be broken into smaller chunks
	-	may need to worry about ordering and sequencing of packets
	-	headers
	-	layer 3 now has to care about addressing of physical machines
	- 	layer 4 - transport layer 
	-	many small frames vs one big frame with many packages
		-	depends on how you're transmitting the data

Design Issues for the Layers
	-	Addressing
	-	Error Control
	-	Flow Control
	-	Multiplexing
	-	Routing

Connection-Oriented and Connnectionless Services
	-	Could senda a Byte stream
		-	Connection Oriented
	-	Connectionless
		-	send chunks, say this message is for x

Service Primitives
	-	Packets sent in a simple client-server interaction on a connection-oriented network
	-	Protocol Stack
		-	Each layer has certain responsibilities for each comunication
		-	Assumes the person on the other end follows the same protocol

Reference Models
	-	transport layer gets the data to individual process
	-	
	-	data link gets clearly defined chunk to destination
	-	physical - what does a bit look like
	-	session - establishing connections
	-	OSI vs TCP/IP
		-	OSI - 7 layers
		-	TCP/IP - ~4 layers

Critique of the OSI Model and Protocols
	-	too early

Hybrid Model
	-	Physical, Data link, network, transport, application

Example Networks
	-	The internet
	-	Connection-Oriented Networks: X.25, Frame Relay, ATM
	-	Ethernet
	-	Wireless LANs: 802:11

	Arpanet: switching network of connections - avoid star model
