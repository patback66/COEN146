Phishing

Security - how do you know you're at the correct site?

Forwarding (from the router/to DNS - not the DNS you wanted)

Man in the middle attack

Application Level Encryption

Attacks and security can be applied at many different layers

Assured Forwarding
  - queued packets have a priority

Expedited Forwarding
  - Expedited packets have a traffic - free network

  Frame
  [PPP | IP | UDP/TCP unit]

Label Switching and MPLS
  - link layer protocol
  - Transmitting a TCP segment using IP, MPLS, and PPP
  - MAC allows you to add extra stuff

The DNS Name Space
  - DNS holds resource records -> database service

Resource Records
  - Information about the hosts, etc that you want to connect to
  - Help with load balancing

Name Servers
  - How a resolver looks up a remote name
    = Recursive lookup
    = Iterative lookup
  - Generic vs countries

"micorsoft.com"

Certificates
  - secure hash is like a checksum
  - public key
  - verify the file is true - public/private key

Required to know
  - hierarchical
  - 2 forms of lookup -> result of hierarchical namespace
  - top level is special
    = delegate to subdomain
  - expensive to add top level domain -> needs infrastructure
  - protocol at the application layer -> many things built on top
    = security guarantees
