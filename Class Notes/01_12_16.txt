The Internet = "A series of tubes"?

Bandwidth	-	data transmitted per time unit - rate of flow of volume of data
Latency		-	time between package sent and packet acknowledged
			-	propagation delay + other times (reciver queue time)
			-	data processing on the receiving end
			-	there can also be quueuing time on transmitter
			-	transmitter queue time + encoding + propagation delay/time + receiver queue time + decoding
Propagation Delay/time 		-	time it takes for a signal to get to final recipient point

Channel Capacity	-	Bandwidth * latency

Performance
	-	transmit = size/bandwidth
	-	propagation = distance/speed of light
	-	latency = propagation + transmit + queue

	-	one bit transmissino -> propagation is important
	-	large bytes transmission -> bandwidth is important
	-	Best network? depends on how much data you need to move

Delay X Bandwidth
	-	We think the channel between a pair of processes as a hollow pipe

RTT	-	Round-trip time	

Bandwidth-Limited Signals
	-	add harmonics - more frequency, more bandwidth

Links
	-	-Plog2(P)
		-	P is a probability
		-	Get a value that is large when unlikely, small when common
	sum(-Pilog2(Pi), 0, i)
		-	how many bits required to describe all events

Link Capacity and Shannon-Hartley Theorem
	-	C=Blog2(1+S/N)
		-	log2 -> binary
		-	B = bandwidth, #changes/sec

Modulation	-	

What can you change about a signal?
	-	Frequency
	-	Amplitude
	-	Phase

	-	QPSK - phase manipulation, 4 possible values
		-	quadrature phase shift keying
	-	QAM	- phase + amplitude
		-	quadrature phase shift keying with amplitude modulation at (16/64)
	-	Phone line limits
		-	33.6 Kbps (kilobits per second) NOT BYTES
		-	from 3000Hz
			-	comes from your voice
	-	But wires can cause emf
		-	twist the wires
		-	Cat3 - 3 twists per unit length
		-	Cat5 - 5
		-	Guided signal, less interference
		-	prevents from acting like an antenna
		-	longer wires - attenuation

Coaxial Cable
	-	braided outer conductor cancels out the emf

REMEMBER: CHANNEL CAPACITY, BANDWIDTH, LATENCY, transmit data by modulating a signal

Fiber Optics
	-	has total internal reflection
	-	multimode and single mode
		-	how good it is at transmitting the light without a lot of bouncing
	-	Networks - need to divide up the signal
		-	multiplexing - give each person a subpart of a frequency range for the wire

Radio transmission

Lightwave Transmission
	-	laser link

Bandwitdth-Limited Signals
	-	encoding, link-to-link framing
	-	FDM vs TDM
	-	encoding and modulation at high speed
