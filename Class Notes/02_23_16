TCP

Destination: IP address
  - IPV4, layer 3 address
  - MAC address: multiple parties sharing the same link


  3 - Packet
  2 Frame
                        [HDR|         ]
  Packet ->         [HDR| Payload     ]
  Frame  -> [ | MAC | Payload/Data    | ]

TCP is a layer of software that accepts packets and interprets packets as a chunk of data
that will be handed off to a process

UDP/TCP
  IP
  ETHERNET

Handle congestion, reliability
  - sender window/receiver window
  -

Receive window size n vs size 1

Transport is the first time we see a process speaking to a process -> encryption at layer 4+

TCP Congestion control

TCP Timer Management
  - AVERAGE
  - Delays may be caused by smaller packet sizes
  - Response times can be dramatically affected -> greater uncertainty is bad

Performance Problems in Computer Networks

Network performance measurement
  - Measure what you care about
  - Adjust the parameter you can change
  - The basic loop for improving network performance
  1)  Measure relevant network parameters, performance
  2)  Try to understand what is going on
  3)  Test again

System Design for better performance
  - Rules
  1)  CPU speed is more important than network speed
  2)  Reduce packet count to reduce software overhead
  3)  Minimize context switches
  4)  Minimize copying
  5)  You can buy more bandwidth but not lower delay
  6)  Avoiding congestion is better than recovering from it
  7)  Avoid timeouts
  - Avoid diminishing returns
