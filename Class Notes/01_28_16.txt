COEN 146 Networks

Logically, where are people?
  - Concerned with network layer 3
  - Tell your neighbors where you are. They tell their neighbors where you are
    - spreading rumors

Routing
  - Done by a router
  - Metric of relative goodness of neighbors

Distance Vector Routing

Network Layer Design Issues
  - store and forward packet switching
  - Services Provided to the transport layer
  - Implementation of connectionless service
  - Implementation of connection-oriented service
  - Comparison of virtual-circuit and datagram subnets

Store and Forward Packet Switching
  -

Implementation of Connectionless Service
  - Routing with a datagram subnet

Implementation of Connection-Oriented Service
  - Routing within a virtual-circuit subnet
  - Separate circuits may contain the same path

Comparison of Virtual Circuit and Datagram
  - Datagram network must contain full address

Amount of data to implement an algorithm
  - amount of data to share/propagate/who to send to
  - amount of data you need to maintain
  - DON'T USE NEGATIVE DISTANCES

Routing Algorithms
  - Optimality Principle
  - Shortest Path Routing
  - Flooding

Flooding
  - Tell neighbors, have them tell their neighbors
  - Tell the world
    - the world tells the world, remembers that they did so so that they don't send it again
  - Keep your own graph (that would be really hard)
    - Routing tables are network addresses, ranges - not system addresses
  - Tricky, lots of traffic

The Optimality Principle
  - A subnet vs A sink tree
    - tree that can reach every node in the graph without a cycle
      - Want to build a spanning tree - reach all nodes, but each has least weight across all edges - minimum spanning tree
      - reach every node with shortest possible path
        - requires to start with the full knowledge of the network
      - Sink tree

Distance Vector Routing
  - See how long it takes for them to reply
  - Fatal Flaw
    - When somebody disappears, then issues arise
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
    - form of Distance Vector routing
    - Instead of maintaining a table of hops, you list the path as well
    - Used on higher layer, between networks that don't have to trust each other


    THurday week 5
    tuesday/thursday week 6

Midterm
  - few questions like quiz
  - problems to work out
  - there will be a review session
    - there will be sample questions
    - don't memorize names, but understand algorithm/approach/reasoning why
