NO MORE NEW MATERIAL

Final: Thursday 9:10
What material?
  - Link-state routing forward


Best route?
  - It depends
  - Traffic
  - Location changes -> nodes move
  - Could calculate the cheapest route, but have to discover it first

Sections
  NOTHING BEFORE CHAPTER 3
  Congestion Control
  TCP
    - change how fast it's speeding up, etc.
    - how fast (on average) you're sending data
    - max rate of transmission
    - TCP Segments -> chunks of data
  Chapter 4
    3.3.3, 3.3.4 *Most important
    3.4.4 *Strongly recommended
      - Implementation
    3.3,3.4 general awareness
  Chapter 4
    Routing algorithms
    4.1.1 bare minimum
    4.1.2 recommended
      Distance vector like algorithm
    4.1 overall, but 4.1.1 is the focus
  Chapter 5
    5.1,5.2 required
    5.4.2 helpful
  Chapter 6
    6.1.1,6.1.2,6.1.3
    Grasp of congestion control
    responsible for general idea of the algorithms

    congestion low, increase segment size. high, decrease
    Leaky bucket
    Packet queueing
      Queue you place the packet on?
        routing algorithm
      Which packet goes out next?
        queuing algorithm
        route trees
        shortest remaining time
        round robin
    6.2
      feels like layer 3 again-
    6.1-6.3
    6.4,6.5 recommended
    6.5.2 very strongly recommended
      RSVP - reserve bandwidth
  Chapter 8
    8.3.4 (Diffie-Helman key exchange)
      establish a secret between people who are speaking in the open
    8.4.1 (PGP)
    secure one way hashes
    public key encryption
    private key encryption
    token exchanges

    authentication protocols
    attacks: why we predistribute keys
  Chapter 9
    DNS
      recursive vs iterative lookups
    9.3.1

Review session: Tuesday probably later afternoon
  BRING QUESTIONS

Size: same as midterm
Full exam time will be available
Assumptions: STATE THEM

Security
  Reflection attack
    - Initial key exchange - impose yourself
    - challenge -> cryptographic secret
    - Prove yourself -> here's a random challenge. Ok, we'll get to that. I challenge you a random challenge
      = Piggybacking the challenge on the initial challenge
  What is a challenge? Purpose?
    - people communicating, need to verify they are who they are
  Clock

Question 4: Window size in TCP?
  ALL THE WINDOW SIZES
  Congestion: how much data willing to transmit based on perceived congestion (which varies)
    - + traffic, - window; - traffic, + window;

Question 3:
  not in direct contact with sender
  I'm being overwhelmed by this link, so choke packets -> say to slow down
  Follow the path

  Network vs transport layer
  ex: IP datagram vs tcp at transport layer
                      receiver noticing congestion could say slow down
                      sender itself sees it is timing out, slows down
                      sender/receiver
      hop by hop

      source - throttle
      Who has the power to stop sending data? Everyone
        - routers rarely originate data
        - network card doesn't always have a say in the frames its sending
          = more limited scope of limiting itself

Token Bucket

Expedited Forwarding
  - experience a traffic-free network

Assured Forwarding
  - Kind of like priority scheduling
  - empty highest priority queue first

Label Switching and MPLS
  - Frame headers, etc. payload
  - TCP segment using IP, MPLS, and PPP
  - packet labeling system

Leaky Bucket
  - problematic, not using the link well - prevent from exceding certain max

Token Bucket
  - instantaneous rate doesn't matter
  - just don't excede a certain average/range
  - generate token - available number
  - token bucket can go into leaky bucket
    = prevents a flood

TCP vs UDP
  - how much detail
  - difference in headers
  - need to be able to explain what the headers contain (if shown)
  - differences between the two
    = TCP has lots of metadata
    = UDP has ports, and that's it
  - what the header stuff does

Easier to say goodbye or hello?
  - clean termination can be difficult

Handshakes?

IP connectionless
