COEN 146 Networks

Communication Satellites

VSAT - Very small atmosphere transmission
	-	bounce signals

	-	Iridium, Globalstar

Modems
	-	modulate and demodulate a signal
	-	amplitude, frequency, phase

Perspectives on Connection
	-	store and forward (routers)

Link Capacity and Shannon-hartley Theorem
	-	gives upper bound to the capacity of a link in ters of bits per second
	-	how you represent the data changes this
	-	properties of the medium
	-	signal to noise ratio

Links
	-	some form of electromagnetic radiation propagating through a medium (or free space)
	-	electromagnetic spectrum
		-	don't want signals to go through things
			-	like gamma rays

Encodeing
	-	Problem with NRZ
		-	Baseline wander
			-	deals with how we represent the signal itself
			-	The receiver keeps an average of the signals it has seen so far
			-	Uses teh average to distinguish between low and high signal
			-	when a signal is significantly lower than the average, it is 0, else it is 1
			-	too many consecutive 0's and 1's cause this average to change, making it difficult to detect
		-	Clock Recovery
			- 	01 = 0
			-	10 = 1
			-	avoid 11 or 00
		-	NRZI
			-	non return to zero inverted
				-	solves all consecutive 1's
				-	doesn't solve all consecutive 0's
				-	sender makes a transition from the current signal to encode 1 and stay at the current signal to encode 0
		-	Manchester encoding
			-	merging clock with signal by transmitting XOR of the NRZ encoded data and the clock
			-	clock is an internal signal that alternates from high to low
			-	guarenteed to always transition
			-	never stay at the same state
			-	helps get timing correct. Won't go more than 2 clock cycles to tell you where you're at
			-	manchester bit rate is half the baud rate
			-	doubles the rate at which the signal transitions are made on the link
				-	receiver has half of teh time to detect each pulse of the signal
		-	4B/5B encoding
			-	insert extra bits into stream to break up the long sequence of 0's and 1's
			-	every 4-bits of actual data are encoded in a 5-bit code that is transmitted to the receiver
			-	5-bit codes are selected in such a way that none has more than one leading 0 and no more than 2 trailing 0's
			-	no pair of 5 bit codes results in more than one
			-	0000 -> 11110	16 left
				0001 -> 01001	11111 - when the line is idle
				001 -> 10100
			-	helps solve framing problem
Framing
	-	Recent PPP 
	-	Flag, Address, Control, Protocol, Payload, Checksum, Flag
	-	Byte-counting approach
		-	DDCMP frame format
	-	Bit-oriented Protocol
		-	HDLC: High level data link control
			-	any 5 consecutive 1's include an extra 0
			-	01111110
			-	ex
				5 consecutive 1's
					-	next bit: 0: stuffed, so discard it
					-	next bit: 1: either end of teh frame marker or Error has been introduced in the bitstream

					If 0 (01111110) -> end of the frame marker
					If 1 (01111111) -> error, discard the whole frame
						-	the receiver needs to wait for the next
					01111110 before it can start receiving again
	-	Error detection
		-	How do we know the data is good? Checksum/hash
		-	bit errors are introduced into frames
			-	because of electrical interference and thermal noises
			-	detecting error, correction error
			-	2 approaches
	-	Common technique for detecting transmission error
		-	CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
			-	used in HDLC, DDCMP, CSMA/CD, Token Ring
		-	Other approaches
			-	Two dimensional parity (BISYNC)
			-	Checksum (IP)
		-	Error correction or detection?
			-	depends
			-	cost of resending high? correction
			-	low? resend

Error Detection
	-	Basic Idea of error detection
		-	add redundant information to a frame that can be used to determine if errors have been introduced
		-	send 2: not the same, which is the error?
		-	so we can know when things go wrong

		-	layer 2 packet
		-	layer 3 frame

Stop and Wait Protocol
	-	depend on timeout
	-	wait for receive response
	-	but what if acknowledgement didn't get back?
	-	need sequence numbers
		-	recognize retransmission

Sliding Window Protocol
	-	power of 2 number of frames

Encoding vs modulation

What does it take to send a frame of data at the link layer?

How do we manage the data? Sliding window protocol

Link layer only seems valid if it looks like a dedicated link
	-	need MAC (media access control)
	-	who gets to talk when it's shared?

READ CHAPTER 1!!!! BRING QUESTIONS!!!


Framing
	-	encode control information
		-	hash value, header, how much data, etc.


Baud 
	-	rate of sending signal elements
		-	signal elements - part of the signal that can change
