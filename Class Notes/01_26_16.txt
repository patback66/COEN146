Sharing a shared medium

Switch vs hub
  - connect multiple ethernet devices
  - switch is active
    - less sharing
    - pretend to be a hub, but smarter
  - hub is passive

The 802.11 MAC Sublayer Protocol

Ethernet MAC Sublayer Protocol
  - Frame formats
    - DIX Ethernet
    - IEEE 802.3
  - Why padding?
    - guarantee a minimum frame size
    - Collision detection

Switched Ethernet
  - What if you connect two switches?
    - Two separate networks taht need to be connected by something smart?
    - Internetworking

IEEE 802.2: Logical Link Control
  - Position of LLC
    - Network Layer <-> LLC, MAC <-> Physical Layer
  - Protocol Formats
    - Packet <-> LLC/Packet, MAC/LLC/Packet/MAC <->Network

Topology
  - Star
  - Bus
  - FDDI -> Ring
    - Token ring network
    - ATM -> asynchronous transfer
  - Logically the same, physically very different

D.A.G.
  - Directed acyclical graph

Channel Capacity
  - maximum amount of data that can be in flight at any time
  - prop delay * amount of data
