Big channel available
  - take part of it
    - multiplexing, arbitration, coordination

  Multiplexing : how we figure out a physical way to subdivide a channel
  Coordination : when you run out of subdivisions, how do you decide who gets use?

  - time ranges, frequency ranges

Frequency Divisino Multiplexing
  - the original bandwidths
  - the bandwidths raised in frequency
    - possibility of crosstalk at edges
      - need high pass and low pass filters
  - the multiplexed channel
  - wavelength division
    - but wavelength and frequency are the same
    - take into account the different attenuation properties

Reliable Transmission
  - CRC is used to detect errors
  - some error codes are strong enough ot correct errors
  - the overhead is typically too high
  - corrupt frames must be discarded
  - a link-level protocol that wants to deliver frames reliably mustrecover from these discarded frames.
  - this is accomplished using a combination of two fundamental mechanisms
    - acknowledgements and timeouts
  - Resend frame
    - need to request a resend
    - So far, only send with special data
      - need send, and if problem resend
      - frame, wait for special signal response,
  - An Acknoledgement (ACK) is a small control frame that a protocol sends back to its peer saying that it has received the earlier frame.
    - a control frame is a frame with header only (no data)
    - the receipt of an acknowledgmenet indicates to the sender of the original frame that its frame was successfully delivered
    - but this is pretty wasteful
    - send all data then wait for a response?
    - Send, resend only what's missing.
    - but what if the frame is incorrect?
      - within each frame, checksum
      - creates a lot of work
      - want efficiency
  -  Dynamically choose protocol?
    - yes, but need a protocol to specify the protocol

Stop and Wait Protocol
  - ack received before timer epixres
  - original frame is lost
  - the ack is lost
  - the timout fires too soon
  - remedy still the same
  - Ack lost or delayed
    - resend the frame
    - looks like new data, but it's a duplicate

Selective Repeat
  - sender window size cannot be more than 1/2 the size of the total size
  - Sender maintains three variables
    - Sending Window Size (SWS)
      - Upper bound on the number of outstanding (unacknowledged) frames that the sender can transmit
    - Last Acknowledgement Received (LAR)
      - Sequence number of the last acknowledgement received
    - Last Frame Sent (LFS)
      - Sequence number of the last frame sent

Go Back N Protocol
  - go back to lost frame and resend all after

Sliding Window Protocol
  - Sender: range of frames to send
  -

Pure ALOHA
  - frames transmitted at completely arbitrary times
  - carrier sense
  - vulnerable period for small overlaps at the start and end
