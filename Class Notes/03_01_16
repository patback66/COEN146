COEN 146 Computer Networks

Security
  - Physical attack - cut the cables and splice yourself in
  - WiFi - encryption... - WEP, WPA
  - Expecting nobody is watching the programs running

Sign it twice -> RSA, public/private keys

Line slope -> need two numbers y = ax + b

Split a secret among multiple people
  - Secret splitting
  - Establish a minimum number of people to disclose a secret

How do you encrypt data
  - code is no good if it preserves structure or its key is easy to guess
  - caeser
  - Vignere -> but dictionary attack
  - Weakness in implementation

Security to know:
  - 4 Concepts/tools
    1)  symmetric key encryption
      - employ a secret that must be shared
    2)  Public key - Encryption
      - what one key does, the other undoes
      - encrypt with private, decrypt with public
    3)  Hashing -> checksum
      - difficulty of guesing data that will produce a specific value
      - want to fulfill a strong property -> MD5, SHA-1 fail
        = Strong: is it possible (in a reasonable amount of time) to find two values that create the same hash
    4) Private Key Encryption

How do you exchange a secret in full view?

Digital signature
  - My name is x, guaranteed by y -> signed by somebody you trust

Authentication Based on a Shared Secret Key
  - two-way authentication using a challenge-response protocol
  - random challenges -> avoid, use single message

Reflection Attack
  - Trudy (as alice): "I'm Alice, random number from Trudy"
  - Bob: "Random from bob. I'm Bob. random from Trudy"
  - Trudy doesn't answer, new connection as trudy
  - Trudy: "Hi I'm trudy, here's a random number I want you to encrypt"
  - Bob responds
  - Trudy (as Alice): continue convo -> now trusted because has bob's random

Establishing a Shared Key:
  - The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
  - alice picks x, bob picks y
  - Alice: 1 -> n, g, g^x mod n
  - Bob: 2 -> g^y mod n
  alice computes (g^y mod n)^x modn = g^xy mod n
  bob computes (g^x mod n)^y mod n = g^xy mod n

To Know:
  private key
  public key
  secure one way encryption
  how do you exchange in full view of the world

mechanics of a protocol are just as important (or more) as the power and resilience to attack as encryption algorithm

If your security is comporomised, do you know?
  Honeypot
    - do a port scan

Last lab -> diffie-hellman
blue slides vs red slide -> mostly just using red
