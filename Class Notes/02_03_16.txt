Review

What kind of addresses have we seen so far?
  - MAC Address
    - Layer 2.5 Medium Access control
    - Logical
    - But where is it?
    - Hex -> 8F:E0:AA:11:48:FE
      - sets of 8 bits
  - IP Address
    - IPV4 127.0.0.1
      - Max 255, min 0
      - each 1 byte
      0.0.0.0 reserved, me
      255.255.255.255 reserved, broadcast
        - send network data through protocol stack, get it back
  - Subnet mask
    XOR of network address
    - only 254 class A networks
      - but not everybody gets 1, so less
  - NAT -> firewall, not a typical router
    - routers look at layer 3

Building Link State Packets
  - a subnet
  - the link state packets for the subnet
    [network (source/dest IP)| data]
    - use subaddresses to indicate where the packet will go
      - be an apartment complex rather than a house
      - 127 is a class A

Shouting? Sending a link layer/broadcast frame

ARP (Layer 2) vs DHCP ()
  - DHCP you broadcast a request, if no response, then send to send to a specific IP (by the router)
    - give you your IP, DNS, who to talk to

Addresses
  - vary by layer
  - some devices lie about those

Material for MT: Up to Link State Routing
  - sample questions online
  - Topics will be posted

REVIEW:

Question 1: Cheetahs
  bandwidth of n cheetahs. Need to know the distance still
  speed only tells propagation delay
  Distance d (miles) then d/60 hours is time it takes to get there
  T = (D/60)hrs
  n * 30,000/D GB/hr
  SANITY CHECK: UNITS -> value of data/time

  -- Data Rate
  -- Channel Capacity
  -- Propagation Delay

Question 4: leaving as a variable is fine
  Data carrying capacity of 300 Hz? can't really say easily
    - but there is a fixed capacity
    - you can ask if you need a value, as long as it isn't core to answering the question
    - when in doubt, variables are fine
      -
  10^6 bytes per frame
  Bytes/s accross a telephone line?
  Bandwidth = B
  10^6 * B

Question 8
  Hamming distance -> # bits difference in representation
    number of bits difference from one to another
  4b vs 5b
  how much room do you have between individual representations of values
  How many bits can go bad and you can be sure of what is sent
  Important for checksums, frame control, error correction
  LOOK AT FRAMING AND PACKING

  Encoding
    8 1's is a 1
    hamming distance between any 2 values is an 8
    less distance less reliable

    Checksum went bad? doesn't matter -> something went bad
      very unlikely, but checksum checks out, data is corrupted perfectly (almost immpossible)

Framing
  - resends
    - go back n
      - Didn't get 2? get 2 3 4 5
      - no such ambiguity -> go back to, send everything after
