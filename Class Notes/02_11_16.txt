COEN 146 Computer Networks

On the final: probably not comprehensive
  - but there still will likely be routing

IPv6 Header
  - addresses are 16 bytes long
  - 16 byte source address

The IP Protocol
  - Security
  - Strict source routing
  - Loose source routing
  - Rcord route
  - Timestamp

Datagram

Hierarchical Routing
  - hierarchy was intended to be clear
  - but now we do classless
    = remember where, and keep track

BUCKETS

Requirements
  - Reliability
  - Delay
  - Jitter
    = bandwidth fluctuation
  - Bandwidth

Guaranteeing quality of service
BUFFERING

Leaky Bucket Algorithm
  - receive data, put it in a buffer, deliver at a fixed rate
  - Sliding window protocol could help with this
    = But IP doesn't care about reliability
  - Load sharing
  -

Token Bucket Algorithm
  - Token for certain volume of data, never will be given more than capacity
    = give tokens at fixed rate
    = rate of data represented by tokens
  - Transmit data as long as you have a token
  - Token -> average you want to receive at, but can drop below a little bit

Admission control
  * Token bucket rate
  * Token bucket size
  * Peak data rate
  - Minimum packet size
  - Maximum packet size

Network performance
  - Rate of data sent vs rate of subnet (has a max)
  - Theoretical: want ramp up to max, then hold at max
  - Hopeful: approach max, probably stay slightly under

Congestion
  - when too much traffic is offered, congestion sets in and performance degrades sharply

General Principles of Congestion control
  - MOnitor the system
    = detect when and where congestion occurs
  - Pass information to where action can be taken
  - Adjust network parameters

Congestion Prevention Policies
  - Transport
    = Retransmission policy
    = Out-of-order caching policy
    - Acknowledgement policy
    - Flow control policy
    - Timeout determination
  - Network
    = Virtual circuits versus datagram inside the subnet
    = Packet queueing and service policy
    = Packet disregard policy
    = Routing algorithm
    = Packet lifetime management
  - Data link
    = Retransmission policy
    = Out-of-order caching policy
    = Acknowledgement policy
    = Flow control policy

Congestion Control in Virtual-Circuit Subnets

UDP

TCP
  - end-to-end -> flow control, quality control, error correction/detection

What does a router do?
  - Find appropriate recipient for packet
  - Scheduling algorithm? It depends, but FIFO works well

Packet Scheduling
  - Round robin
  - Shortest packet first, with a round robin twist
    = WON'T CAUSE STARVATION
    = Maximises throughput going out
